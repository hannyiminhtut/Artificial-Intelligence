# Artificial-Intelligence
# Face Recognition Based Attendance System

This is a Python-based Face Recognition Attendance System that uses OpenCV and Haar Cascade Classifier for real-time face detection and recognition. The system captures faces, trains a recognizer, and marks attendance automatically based on recognized faces.

ðŸ“Œ Features

- Real-time face detection using Haar Cascade
- Face recognition using OpenCV's LBPHFaceRecognizer
- Attendance is automatically recorded in a CSV file with Name, ID, Date, and Time
- User-friendly interface for training data and taking attendance
- Easily extendable and customizable

ðŸ§° Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- Haar Cascade Classifier
- NumPy
- CSV for attendance logs

ðŸ“¸ How It Works

1. **Face Dataset Creation**: Captures multiple images of the user's face and stores them for training.
2. **Model Training**: Uses the LBPH (Local Binary Pattern Histogram) algorithm to train the recognizer on the captured images.
3. **Face Recognition & Attendance**: Detects and recognizes faces in real-time and records attendance if a face is recognized.

After adding the required libraries for project , it is run by using the command " python attendance_system.py " .
